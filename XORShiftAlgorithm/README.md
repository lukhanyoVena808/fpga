In this implementation, xorshift32 is the function that generates the pseudo-random numbers using the XORshift algorithm. It takes a pointer to an unsigned integer state as a parameter, which represents the current state of the algorithm. The function updates the state and returns the generated random number.
In the main function, we initialize the state with an arbitrary value (123456789 in this case), and then we call xorshift32 in a loop to generate and print 10 random numbers.
Note that this implementation uses a 32-bit version of the XORshift algorithm. If you need a different bit size, you can modify the shift amounts accordingly. Also, make sure to seed the initial state with a non-zero value for better randomness.
